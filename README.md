This is a first version of a Wordpress plugin.

It was build to learn more about Wordpress.

It is not really a product at the moment.

It will create a menu with 2 submenu's and 2 pages.

It is at least a start to creating a plugin with an Object Oriented setup. 

Currently I am working on a different Wordpress Plugin.

In the future I will restart developing a better rest-api JWT plugin.

For now this project is closed.
